# Anomaly Detection

The project is based on a set of data collected from a manufacturing process, in which both in-control and out-of-control data are present. You are asked to develop a method or a procedure to identify the data falling in the respective categories, i.e., which ones are in-control and which ones out of control. This is amounted to a Phase I analysis, whose purpose to isolate the in-control data for estimating the in-control distribution parameters so that a monitoring scheme can be set up for future missions.
